To analyze the reviews by shopper
The project is based on reviwes which are given by shoppers and I am trying to analyzing reviews using NLP and machine learning

The data I downloaded from kaggle and import in jupyter notebook

The main perspective to apply NLP on reviews column to analyse the postive and negative reviews and also work in rating column to predict the reviews rating.


For working on Reviews column I used Bag of word and RegexpTokenizer to remove unwanted elements from out data like symbols and numbers and after that using TFIDF vector to convert the reviws txt into vector .

And for predicting rating I used some ML algorithm like MultinomialNB , Random Forest ,Decison Tree .

and last one is created a WorldCloud which show you the most repeated word in the reviews column .
